Accesstools can be used to get private fields.
It can be used like you use typeof(sometype).GetField().

For example:

FieldInfo fiunplayedSongs =AccessTools.Field(typeof(MusicManager.DynamicSongPlaylist), "unplayedSongs");
List<string> unplayedsongs = (List<string>) fiunplayedSongs.GetValue(__instance);
		
    
foreach (string song in blacklist) {
		unplayedsongs.Remove(song);
}
fiunplayedSongs.SetValue(__instance, unplayedsongs);

Getvalue(__instance) gets the value of that field from that instance.
