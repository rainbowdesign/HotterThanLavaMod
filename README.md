    - The hotter than lava changes **heater and pumps** so **they dont overheat** and changes wolframite and tungsten to not melt. It also adds **Mercury as a coolant** that will stay liquid deep into minus degrees. 


- **ImprovedAnimalsMod.dll**

    - The improved animals mod adds some more element transformations you can get from different **Hatches**: 
    - Hatches eat Diamond and regolith. 
    - Metal Hatches eat now MaficRock and Bleachstone. 
    - Rock Hatches now give off slime. 
    - Sage hatches eat Algae and give off polluted Water. There are some more changes.


- **AdaptedElementsMod.dll**

    - The mod makes it **hard to build a Steam turbine** you need to craft special materials from heated and frozen materials. You need to make frozen petrolium and carbon dioxide aswell as heat pyrite. Best you use it with **HotterThanLavaMod.dll**
